This Repository **Dotfiles** contain my personal config files. Here you'll find configs, customizations, themes, and whatever I need to personalize my mac OS experience.

## Terminal and Application Icons with Nerd-Fonts
To display icons in terminal or applications Fonts, I'm using [Nerd-Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com). I'm currently using the **Hack Nerd Font Mono** in terminal applications, and **Hack Nerd Font** in applications.

## Terminal Prompt is via Starship
This is always a dynamic config that sways with my mode and needs.  Lucky for me it is pretty easy to tweak. Check them out [Starship](https://starship.rs).
